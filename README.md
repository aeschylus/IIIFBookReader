# IIIF Adapter for the OpenLibrary BookReader
## Introduction
The following simple plugin is designed to extend the Internet Archive's [ BookReader javascript library ](https://github.com/openlibrary/bookreader), part of their [ OpenLibrary ](https://openlibrary.org/) project, so that IABookReader instances can consume images served from a IIIF-compatible backend. Many of the world's top universities, libraries, museums, and repositories have made thousands of previously inaccessible, rare resources freely and interoperably available using the IIIF API specifications. For more information, explore the documentation on [iiif.io](https://www.iiif.io).
